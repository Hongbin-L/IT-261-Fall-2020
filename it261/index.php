 <p>I am a immigrant, and I have lived in the United States for 3 years. My English is not very well, so I am still in ESL class. I was an anime designer when I was in China. Someone asked me that why I didn't continue to do animation design in the United States. My answer was I want to learn something new that I don't know. So I am here today to study web design.</p>

<h3>about me</h3>
        
     <p>I like the science of the unknown especially beyond earth, the center of the earth and ocean. The earth is too small in the universe, so I am curious about the universe and galaxy. The center of the earth is also a place that humans have not yet to reach. The oceans cover 71% of the earth. There are many unknown creatures that humans have not yet to discover, and most of them live in the deep sea. So my website will be about unknown sciense.</p>
